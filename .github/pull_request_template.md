After you have read the [instructions for adding a theme](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemesSiteBuilder/blob/main/README.md#adding-a-theme),
please check that your theme.toml [is complete](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemesSiteBuilder/blob/main/README.md#theme-configuration):

- [ ] name
- [ ] license
- [ ] licenselink
- [ ] description
- [ ] homepage
- [ ] demosite (if one exists)
- [ ] tags
- [ ] features
- [ ] authors/author (depending on whether the theme has multiple or a single author)
- [ ] original (if the theme is a fork)

Please also make sure to [use absolute paths for images](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemesSiteBuilder/blob/main/README.md#use-absolute-paths-for-images)
in your README.md, so that they will be displayed at themes.gohugo.io.
